# ‚öñÔ∏è Network Load Balancer

Welcome to the **Network Load Balancer** project! This Python-based application utilizes Q-learning to efficiently distribute jobs across network nodes, ensuring optimal performance and minimal job migration. The GUI is built with Tkinter, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- üåê **Dynamic Network Configuration**: Easily add nodes and edges to simulate different network topologies.
- ü§ñ **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning algorithm for intelligent job scheduling and migration.
- üìä **Visualization**: Graphical representation of the network and job distribution using Matplotlib.
- üîÑ **Job Migration Tracking**: Keep track of job migrations and analyze performance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìã Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Required Python libraries: `tkinter`, `ttkthemes`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tk ttkthemes networkx matplotlib
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-load-balancer.git
   cd network-load-balancer
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface Overview

### üéõÔ∏è Main Interface

- **Add Nodes**: Define the number of nodes and their capacities.
- **Add Edges**: Create connections between nodes to simulate the network topology.
- **Run Scheduler**: Submit jobs to the network and observe the job distribution and migrations.
- **Visualize Graph**: Display a graphical representation of the network and job allocations.

### üìú Instructions

1. **Add Nodes**:
   - Click 'Add Nodes' and specify the number of nodes and their respective capacities.
2. **Add Edges**:
   - Click 'Add Edges' and define the connections between nodes.
3. **Run Scheduler**:
   - Click 'Run Scheduler' to submit jobs and see the scheduling results, including any job migrations.
4. **Visualize Graph**:
   - Click 'Visualize Graph' to view the network graph with job allocations.

## üß© Code Overview

The main components of the project include:

- **QLearningAgent**: Implements the Q-learning algorithm for job scheduling.
- **Node**: Represents a network node with capacity and job handling.
- **Graph**: Manages the network topology, job submissions, and migrations.
- **JobSchedulerGUI**: The Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction.
